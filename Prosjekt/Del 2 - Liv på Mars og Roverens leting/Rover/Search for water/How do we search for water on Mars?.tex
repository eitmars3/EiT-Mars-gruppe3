\section*{How do we search for water on Mars?}
Earlier we have explained why water is important to life, and why the Mars Rover searches for it.
We have yet to go into the details of the methods used.
This section will do exactly that.


Curiosity is basically an experimental lab with wheels.
It was sendt through space and landed on the red planet by use of advanced control systems and brilliant engineering.
The lab is equipped with serval different instruments, and we will cover some of them.
