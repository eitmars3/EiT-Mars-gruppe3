As one of the Curiosity rover's tasks is to analyse the composition of the Martian surface, it carries an onboard laboratory called Chemistry & Camera (ChemCam).
 The ChemCam is a composition of two separate instruments: a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) and a Remote Micro-Imager (RMI).
