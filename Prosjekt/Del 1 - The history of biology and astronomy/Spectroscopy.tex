\subsection*{The principles behind spectroscopy}
Spectroscopy is a method used in experimental physics to obtain information about a material.
In general one sends some kind of radiation towards the material, and then observes what happens afterwards.
Common radiation used in spectroscopy is photons, alpha, beta and gamma radiation.
