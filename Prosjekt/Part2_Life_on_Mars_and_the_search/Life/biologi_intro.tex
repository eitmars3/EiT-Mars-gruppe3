\subsection{Intro}
We have a tendency to think of ourselves as single, large unit. 
Your body belongs to you; your hands are yours, you own your legs, your heart beats for you, your lungs pump air for your continued existance. 
This is true, but it also glosses over the immense detail of the organic machinery that fuels you.
Within you exists an amount of tiny creatures analogous to grains of sand on a beach; a multitude of biodiversity that lives out every minor function in the larger you. There is a constant churn of chemical reactions, energy transfer, communication signals, mechanical interactions, transfer of data and matter from one place in the body to another, from one cell to another. This is the giant, inter-connected factory of yourself, and your workers count in the hundreds of billions. You are the CEO of a very big biological business, even though you do not feel it.
It all begins at the microscopic level. So, what do the building blocks of your human machine look like? How do they work together, how do they build, grow and expand? How do they know what to do? How does a network of tiny little cells, together, give you the capacity to wonder at your place in the stars, to feel love until your heart bursts, and even to know that some day your biological machine will shut down?

It all begins - no psychedelics reference - it all begins with \emph{acid}.
