\initial{A}s explained earlier, finding water on Mars is not the hard part.
Liquid water, on the other hand, is a whole other story.
The rover has a wide array of apparatuses ready to help the crew sitting on Earth with the biological treasure hunt.
Many of these are cameras used for driving and navigating.
Others are used to gather information.
We will focus on some them:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemistry \& Camera
\item Chemistry \& Mineralogy
\item Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer
\item Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons
\item Radiation Assessment Detector
\end{itemize}

Curiosity has been equipped with these instruments to be able to find and analyze mineral samples and the Martian environment.
The samples will hopefully contain information that proves Mars had liquid water in the past.
Environmental tests can tell us how likely there is that traces of former life could be found, and even how much it would take to make Mars habitable to humans.
