\initial{B}eing equipped with instruments and protection to tackle the Martian environment, Curiosity was ready to start its mission.
Although almost all the technological barriers had been broken, one of the most important ones was still standing.
NASA had to get the rover to Mars.
Other rovers have already made the journey, but this time it was a little bit different.

On November 26th 2011, Curiosity left Earth with a one way ticket away from home.
More than eight months later, on August 6th 2012, it arrived in the vicinity of Mars.
The only thing between the almost $1000kg$ heavy rover and its final destination was the atmosphere of Mars.
This would be the final major challenge Curiosity had to face!
