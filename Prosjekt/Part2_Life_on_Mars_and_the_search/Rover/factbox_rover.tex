\textbf{Purpose:} To investigate the climate and geology on Mars, and to find evidences for the presence of water.

\textbf{Travel:} From November 26th 2011 in Miami to August 6th 2012 at the Gale Crater.

\textbf{Planned mission duration:} One Martian year, that is 98 weeks.

\textbf{Mass/size:} The mass is $900 kg$. The dimensions are $3 m x 2,8 m x 2,1 m$, about the size of a car.

\textbf{Movement:} The rover can travel by an average of $30 m$ per hour.

\textbf{Instruments:} It has 17 cameras, most of them are used to drive and navigate.

\textbf{Energy source:} The onboard nuclear power plant carries plutonium-238. From the material's decay it can produce $125 W$ of electricity.

\textbf{Computers:} The two identical computers are specially built to tolerate the radiation that occur on Mars. They have only $256 MB$ of RAM and $2 GB$ of flash memory each.

\textbf{Communication:} The rover uses its three antennas to communicate in the UHF band. Direct communication to the Earth takes about 7 minutes. The rover can also communicate via Mars satellites.

\textbf{Cost:} The overall cost was $2,5 billion USD$, where 1,8 billion of it was used on freighting the rover to Mars.
