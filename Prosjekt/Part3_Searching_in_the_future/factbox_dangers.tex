\textbf{Atmosphere:} It is impossible to breath in, due to its low density, as well as its high concentration of carbon dioxide.

\textbf{Radiation:} There is constant background radiation on Mars, but there is also a much stronger direct radiation from the Sun.
With no significant protection from the Martian atmosphere nor a planet wide magnetic field, radiation can reach intensities enough to ionize atoms and thus split chemical compounds, making the environment tough to any living creature we know of.

\textbf{Climate:} Liquid water is not known to occur on Mars, however the poles have permafrost. The warmest climate on Mars, and thus the most friendly to humans, is to be found around its equator.

\textbf{Meteorites:} Mars is located closer to the asteroid belt than Earth, and with weak protection from the atmosphere, the Martian surface gives a clue on how great consequences these impacts may cause.

\textbf{Health:} Living in low gravity causes the human body to slowly fall apart.
This is crucial when travelling to Mars, but could also be significant at the Martian surface.
It is also expected that isolation so far from home could affect the traveller's mental health.
