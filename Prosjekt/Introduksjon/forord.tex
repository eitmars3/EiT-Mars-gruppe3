The aim of the paper is to bring the interested reader to a level of layman's competence, and to give an overview of the relevant scientific and philosophical topics of extra-terrestrial life.
It is intended to induce a sense of wonder and to present a foundation for curiousity on the theme. It looks to find an answer to the importance of human curiousity in the search for extra-terrestrial life, on which technical solutious this has led to, and how this search can develop in the future.  
The paper is written for the fascinated amateur \emph{by} the fascinated amateur, and presents the hunt for life on Mars through a broader scope.
