\initial{T}his paper has been written for the NTNU class TBT4850 Experts in Team.
It has been written by a team of engineers from different disciplines.

The class is biology-oriented, and because the team had no biologists, the team have chosen a broader approach. A third of the group is international, therefore the paper is written in English. 
The paper is written for the fascinated amateur by the fascinated amateur, and presents the hunt for life on Mars through a broader scope.
The aim of the paper is to bring the fascinated amateur to a level of layman's competence, and to give an overview of the relevant scientific and philosophical topics of extra-terrestrial life.
It is intended to induce a sense of wonder and to present a foundation for curiousity on the theme.
